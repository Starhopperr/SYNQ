# SynQ - Android Chat Application

SynQ is a streamlined Android chat application built with Java and Firebase. It focuses on core real-time communication between users with a secure authentication system.
the Project is created to implement the learnings of android development and object oriented programming through java.

## 🚀 Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure signup and login using Firebase Authentication with SHA-256 password hashing.
- **Real-Time Messaging:** Instant message exchange between users powered by Firebase Realtime Database.
- **Profile Viewing:** A dedicated profile section where users can view their current account details and profile picture.
- **One-Time Registration Setup:** Users set their username, email, and profile picture (via ImgBB) during registration.
- **Modern UI:** Responsive design utilizing the SDP/SSP libraries to ensure a consistent experience across different device sizes.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Language:** Java
- **Backend:** Firebase (Realtime Database, Authentication)
- **Image Storage:** ImgBB API (Used during registration)
- **Libraries:**
    - **Glide:** For efficient image loading and caching.
    - **CircleImageView:** For circular profile image displays.
    - **OkHttp:** For networking and ImgBB API integration.
    - **SDP/SSP:** For scalable and responsive UI layouts.
    - **Material Design Components:** For a clean and professional user interface.
